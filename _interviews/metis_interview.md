todo:
    - (sb) From the transscript it cannot be concluded who speaks. Please add this.  
    - (sb) Could it be that it contains only answers, and no questions? Very confusing.
    - (sb) What is the meaning of the yellow markings? Should be explained here below. 
#     - read the transcript and fix issues with speech-to-text, if any
