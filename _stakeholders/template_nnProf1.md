## Profile

nnProf1 has been teaching at the university for many years. He particularly represents teaching in the areas of modeling,
software engineering and project management. In these subjects he has been using virtual teaching and examination 
methods for quite some time. 

However, he has not yet found a way to individualize the examination tasks. During the Corona pandemic, nnProf1 noticed 
above all that completely virtual teaching would reduce the possibility of communication quality among and 
between all persons in the university environment. 

## Areas of activity in teaching

* Modeling
* Project Management
* Software engineering

## Relevance as a Stakeholder

nnProf1, like many of his colleagues, sets students tasks in his courses that are to be solved digitally by means of software
software or require different media for processing. However, not all tasks can be assessed automatically. 
Likewise, there is still no individualization of the tasks in his courses,
but he is very interested in this feature. For this reason, it was important and helpful to include 
and interview this stakeholder.
