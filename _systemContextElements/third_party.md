    - (sb) This is probably a quite unrealistic example, as Classter seems to be a commercial product (?). I guess that e.g. Moodle

METIS will have to be open to integration with third-party services (if any) already used by the school.
<br>Example: Integration with attendance systems currently used by the school.
