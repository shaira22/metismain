description: >
    "Public institutions are governed at the highest level by their state legislatures. They
    determine base budgets and often salaries and benefits. A substantial portion of
    legislative control may be delegated to a board of regents, or equivalent, for public
    institutions. Boards of trustees usually play this role for private institutions." (Rouse, 2016)
