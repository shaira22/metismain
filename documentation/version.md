### 2022-06-16

* Priorization template added to document priorizations. 
* Added a "prioScore:" field to functional requirements. The higher the score, the more important the FR.
  Blank means "not prioritized", e.g. filtered out in the 1st pass.
* Some bug fixes.
* PDF generation in the build disabled for now, as they cost too much build time (waiting time + costs, as
  build minutes need to be paid for ...). Will fix this in later version.

    come with the tool, as a template) are filtered, and don't appear in the UI. 
  * NOTE: in your own *.md files, you need to delete "isTemplate: " attribute in the front matter. (Just setting
    to "false" is not sufficient)
