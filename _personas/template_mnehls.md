## Description

Mark Nehls is 56 years old and a professor for computer science at TH Köln. He has held the professorship for 14 years.
Before that, he has 13 years of work experience as a consultant for companies 
and public authorities. His main focus is in programming and system integration. For example, he teaches the 
use of PHP, Java, shell scripts, etc. Important focal points of system integration are Linux, setting up a VM, 
networking, automation, data backup and much more.

For teaching his courses during the Corona pandemic, Mark has used a special setup. 
He has two webcams, one for his face, and one for the whiteboard. 
With an extra monitor for chat messages, he feels that he can give authentic
lectures, even remotely. It's especially important for him to make lessons interactive. He avoids pure
"PowerPoint events". 

Live coding sessions, where Mark develops a small program ad-hoc, is very 
important to him. After an introduction, the students are asked to program in small groups, but can ask questions at any time.
The final one-on-one discussions about the results are seen by Mark as an excellent way to achieve the 
learning goals, and to close possible gaps in understanding immediately. The idea of
individual one-on-one digital meetings is something Mark would like to keep, even when returning to "normal"
university life after the pandemic.

Mark has also already automated some of the teaching himself. Together with a colleague, he has created question pools
in ILIAS. With the help of self-developed scripts and Java programs, an exercise can be
individualized for each student. However, he uses these tools only in workshops, not for grading or exams.
A big problem of his scripts is that not all tasks have the same level of difficulty.
In addition, grading is an issue for Professor Nehls that he does not want to automate under any circumstances.
It is important to him to assess a student in a personal expert discussion, and to grade as fairly as possible.

Mark is a bit reluctant towards a tool like "Divekit". He is very satisfied with the scripts he
developed scripts, and their easy adaptability. Furthermore, he is concerned that too much tool usage might lead
to the wrong priorities in teaching - automation instead of interaction. However, he finds the concept of
of code wars very interesting, and could imagine incorporating something similar into his teaching, if a 
tool like Divekit would support this.

In order to be considered by Professor Nehls, a software like Divekit must meet rigid quality criteria. For one thing
it must be developed as open source, be hostable in the university's own network, and ensure data privacy.
A tool that students can use to solve tasks independently should also be anonymized, and usable without 
external control by a third person. Furthermore, it should be able to work with any
development environment, so that students can work with their preferred IDE. If these criteria were met, Mark
could imagine taking a closer look at Divekit, and perhaps integrating his own scripts there.
