## Description

Emilia van Linden is 19 years old. She is an ambitious student in the third semester of computer science
at TH KÃ¶ln. After achieving a good Abitur degree at Gymnasium at the age of 18, she started with her studies 
right away. Before her studies she only had a few contact points with programming within a working group at her school.
These were limited to HTML, CSS and a little JS.

Emilia knows that she is easily distracted, and learns better in interactions with a group.
If she has questions or problems in her studies, she either used the services offered by the university, or
asks her fellow students. In general, she values personal contact with other people very much.
This is why the pandemic is quite hard for her. Working alone in her "home office" depresses her. She misses
the tutors that were always available for questions in her first study year, when Corona was yet unheard of.
She uses WhatsApp and Discord to communicate with her fellow students remotely, but it is not quite the same for
her as talking to them face-to-face. However, through her private use of Discord (she games a lot), she is
pretty well used to Discord, and finds it a relatively good messenger. 

Her first two semesters went well. There she has already worked with IntelliJ and Git in other modules.
In the third semester, she is participating in the practical for the software engineering module, ST1. 
She is already very motivated, since she heard that the professor uses a toolkit named "Divekit" that 
enforces a lot of programming work to be done by the students. However, she is a bit worried 
about not getting along with the tool, sitting all alone at home. She is afraid she might not 
pass the practical. Getting familiar with new tools in the remote and online situation means a 
lot of time and effort for her. That is why she would like a good tutorial, or some
other assistance that would support her in using the tool, and make it easy for her to get started.
